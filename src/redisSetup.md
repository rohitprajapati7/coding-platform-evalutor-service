### steps to integrate Message Queue in Node.js with BullMQ and Redis



```
1. What is message queue
A message queue is a mechanism for communicating between different components of an application in an asynchronous way. It allows components to produce and consume messages independently, without having to directly interact with each other. This loose coupling provides flexibility, scalability and reliability benefits to applications.

```

```
2. What are Message Queues?

A message queue works by having a producer component add a job or message to the queue, while a separate consumer component removes jobs from the queue and processes them. 

```

```
3. What is BullMQ

- BullMQ is a fast, robust and opinionated message queue library for Node.js based on Redis. 
- Built on top of Redis for high performance and scalability

```


```
BullMQ Concepts

Queue — The queue instance where jobs are added and processed from. This is the primary interface apps interact with.
Job — A unit of work added to the queue by producers. Consists of job data and metadata.
Worker — A process that consumers jobs from the queue and executes them.
Producer — Any part of the app that adds jobs to a queue.
Consumer — The workers that process jobs from the queues.
Job lifecycle — Various states a job goes through like waiting, active, completed, failed, delayed etc.
Job data — Custom data passed while creating a job that the worker uses to process it.
Job options — Metadata like delays, lifecycle events, retries etc that modify job execution.
Redis — The message broker used by BullMQ to persist job data.

### 4. Setting up BullMQ with Redis

1. npm install bullmq ioredis
2. Then create a BullMQ queue client instance and connect it to a Redis
